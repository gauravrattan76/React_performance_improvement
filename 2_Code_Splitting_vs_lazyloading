Code splittings vs lazy loading-


Code splitting = Breaking JavaScript into chunks.


Code splitting is the process of breaking a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. This helps optimize performance by loading only the required code when needed.


Code splitting is often done using dynamic imports (import()).
js
CopyEdit


const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

Webpack automatically splits this into a separate chunk file.

__________________________________________


Lazy loading is the practice of delaying the loading of a component or resource until it is needed.


import React, { Suspense } from "react"; 
// Lazy load component
 const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));
 const App = () =>
 ( <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}> <LazyComponent /> 
</Suspense> );


React.lazy() + Suspense enables lazy loading by deferring the componentâ€™s loading.


Code Splitting creates separate chunks for different parts of the app.â€¨âœ… Lazy Loading loads those chunks only when needed.
* Code Splitting = The technical process of breaking code into smaller files.
* Lazy Loading = The strategy of loading those files only when necessary.
ðŸ“Œ Lazy loading is a use case of code splitting!

_________________


Even if you split code, it doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s lazy loaded. Example:
js
CopyEdit
import("./utils").then((module) => {
  module.default();
});


This splits the code, but it loads immediately (not lazy-loaded).

Code splitting = Breaking JavaScript into chunks.
Lazy loading = Deferring loading of chunks until needed.
Together, they make React apps faster and more efficient!
