Improving performance of react app-
_________________________________________________

1. Use Production Builds
React's development mode includes helpful warnings and checks that are unnecessary in production and can slow down your app. To create an optimized production build:React
bash
CopyEdit
npm run build

This command generates a minified version of your app in the build/ directory, ensuring faster load times and better performance. React

2. Code Splitting with React.lazy and Suspense

Code splitting allows you to load parts of your application lazily, reducing the initial load time. Here's how you can implement it:Stack Overflow+6Medium+6DEV Community+6


import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

3. Memoization with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback

Memoization helps prevent unnecessary re-renders by caching the results of expensive function calls.


React.memo: Wraps a functional component to prevent re-rendering if props haven't changed.


useMemo: Memoizes the result of a calculation between renders.


useCallback: Returns a memoized version of a callback function.

4.Virtualize Long Lists


Rendering long lists can be performance-intensive. Libraries like react-window and react-virtualized help by rendering only the visible items.


import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const MyList = ({ items }) => (
  <List
    height={500}
    itemCount={items.length}
    itemSize={35}
    width={300}
  >
    {({ index, style }) => (
      <div style={style}>
        {items[index]}
      </div>
    )}
  </List>
);

5. Lazy Load Images
Loading all images upfront can slow down your app. Lazy loading defers the loading of images until they are needed.Bacancy
jsx
CopyEdit
import { LazyLoadImage } from 'react-lazy-load-image-component';

const LazyImage = ({ src, alt }) => (
  <LazyLoadImage
    src={src}
    alt={alt}
    effect="blur"
  />
);

6. Optimize State Management
Efficient state management prevents unnecessary re-renders.Reddit+1DEV Community+1
* Lift state up: Only keep state in components that need it.
* Use Context API wisely: Avoid overusing context, as it can lead to performance issues.
* Consider external libraries: Libraries like Redux or Zustand can help manage complex state efficiently.
Proper state management ensures that components only re-render when necessary.

7. Avoid Anonymous Functions in JSX
Defining functions inside JSX can lead to unnecessary re-renders.DEV Community
jsx
CopyEdit
// Avoid
<button onClick={() => doSomething()}>Click me</button>

// Prefer
const handleClick = () => doSomething();
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

By defining functions outside of JSX, you prevent the creation of new function instances on each render.

8. Use Keys in Lists
When rendering lists, always provide a unique key prop to each item.Medium+2DEV Community+2Bacancy+2
jsx
CopyEdit
{items.map(item => (
  <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
))}

This helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, optimizing the rendering process. Medium

9. Implement Throttling and Debouncing
For performance-intensive events like scrolling or resizing, use throttling or debouncing to limit the rate at which functions are called.
jsx
CopyEdit
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

const handleResize = debounce(() => {
  // Resize logic
}, 300);

useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);

This approach prevents performance bottlenecks caused by rapid event firing.

10. Profile and Monitor Performance
Use React Developer Tools to profile your application and identify performance bottlenecks.React
* Profiler Tab: Analyze component render times and identify unnecessary re-renders.
* Flamegraph: Visualize component render hierarchies and durations.DEV Community+2React+2Stack Overflow+2
Regular profiling helps maintain optimal performance as your application grows. MaybeWorks+2React+2DEV Community+2
